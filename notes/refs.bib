  abstract = {The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model has gained prominence in recent years with the discovery that it unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. By its association with the Ising problem in physics, the QUBO model has emerged as an underpinning of the quantum computing area known as quantum annealing and has become a subject of study in neuromorphic computing. Through these connections, QUBO models lie at the heart of experimentation carried out with quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems and neuromorphic computers developed by IBM. Computational experience is being amassed by both the classical and the quantum computing communities that highlights not only the potential of the QUBO model but also its effectiveness as an alternative to traditional modeling and solution methodologies. This tutorial discloses the basic features of the QUBO model that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range of applications that have thrust it onto center stage of the optimization field. We show how many different types of constraining relationships arising in practice can be embodied within the "unconstrained" QUBO formulation in a very natural manner using penalty functions, yielding exact model representations in contrast to the approximate representations produced by customary uses of penalty functions. Each step of generating such models is illustrated in detail by simple numerical examples, to highlight the convenience of using QUBO models in numerous settings. We also describe recent innovations for solving QUBO models that offer a fertile avenue for integrating classical and quantum computing and for applying these models in machine learning.},

  abstract = {Optimizing objective functions stands to benefit significantly from leveraging quantum computers, promising enhanced solution quality across various application domains in the future. However, harnessing the potential of quantum solvers necessitates formulating problems according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, demanding significant expertise in quantum computation and QUBO formulations. This expertise barrier limits access to quantum solutions. Fortunately, automating the conversion of conventional optimization problems into QUBO formulations presents a solution for promoting accessibility to quantum solvers. This article addresses the unmet need for a comprehensive automatic framework to assist users in utilizing quantum solvers for optimization tasks while preserving interfaces that closely resemble conventional optimization practices. The framework prompts users to specify variables, optimization criteria, as well as validity constraints and, afterwards, allows them to choose the desired solver. Subsequently, it automatically transforms the problem description into a format compatible with the chosen solver and provides the resulting solution. Additionally, the framework offers instruments for analyzing solution validity and quality. Comparative analysis against existing libraries and tools in the literature highlights the comprehensive nature of the proposed framework. Two use cases (the knapsack problem and linear regression) are considered to show the completeness and efficiency of the framework in real-world applications. Finally, the proposed framework represents a significant advancement towards automating quantum computing solutions and widening access to quantum optimization for a broader range of users.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore graph partitioning (GP) using quantum annealing on the D-Wave 2X machine. Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic structure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph partitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into smaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efficient. Unconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the modularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum annealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into equal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required. This reformulation may employ the graph complement to fit the problem in the Chimera graph of the quantum annealer. Partitioning into 2 parts, 2{\textasciicircum}N parts recursively, and k parts concurrently are demonstrated with benchmark graphs, random graphs, and small material system density matrix based graphs. Results for graph partitioning using quantum and hybrid classical-quantum approaches are shown to equal or out-perform current "state of the art" methods.},

A prerequisite of building a quantum annealer is the implementation of programmable long-range two-, three-, or multispin Ising interactions. We discuss an architecture, where the required spin interactions are implemented via two-port or in general multiport quantum Ising wires connecting the spins of interest. This quantum annealing architecture of spins connected by Ising quantum wires can be realized by exploiting the three-dimensional (3D) character of atomic platforms, including atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg tweezer arrays. The realization only requires engineering on-site terms and two-body interactions between nearest neighboring qubits. The locally coupled spin model on a 3D cubic lattice is sufficient to effectively produce arbitrary all-to-all coupled Ising Hamiltonians. We illustrate the approach for few-spin devices solving Max-Cut and prime factorization problems, and discuss the potential scaling to large atom-based systems.},

Optimizing independent sets is one of the paradigmatic, NP-hard problems in computer science. Our approach is based on coherent manipulation of atom arrays via the excitation into Rydberg atomic states. Specifically, we show that solutions of MIS problems can be efficiently encoded in the ground state of interacting atoms in 2D arrays by utilizing the Rydberg blockade mechanism. By studying the performance of leading classical algorithms, we identify parameter regimes, where computationally hard instances can be tested using near-term experimental systems. Practical implementations of both quantum annealing and variational quantum optimization algorithms beyond the adiabatic principle are discussed.},

Here we present experiments with Rydberg atoms to solve one of the NP-hard problems, the maximum independent set (MIS) of graphs. We introduce the Rydberg quantum wire scheme with auxiliary atoms to engineer long-ranged networks of qubit atoms. Three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg-atom arrays are constructed, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of two-dimensional arrays. We demonstrate Kuratowski subgraphs and a six-degree graph, which are the essentials of non-planar and high-degree graphs. Their MIS solutions are obtained by realizing a programmable quantum simulator with the quantum-wired 3D arrays. Our construction provides a way to engineer many-body entanglement, taking a step toward quantum advantages in combinatorial optimization.},

  abstract = {Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm's performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.},

Here we present an experimental protocol with Rydberg atoms to determine the maximum independent set of graphs9, defined as an independent set of vertices of maximal size. Our proposal is based on a Rydberg quantum wire scheme, which exploits auxiliary atoms to engineer long-ranged networks of qubits. We experimentally test the protocol on three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of two-dimensional arrays for tackling combinatorial problems and encode high-degree vertices. We find the maximum independent set solutions with our programmable quantum-wired Rydberg simulator for Kuratowski subgraphs10 and a six-degree graph, which are paradigmatic examples of non-planar and high-degree graphs, respectively.

  abstract = {Rydberg atom arrays are among the leading contenders for the demonstration of quantum speedups. Motivated by recent experiments with up to 289 qubits [Ebadi et al., Science 376, 1209 (2022)], we study the maximum-independent-set problem on unit-disk graphs with a broader range of classical solvers beyond the scope of the original paper. We carry out extensive numerical studies and assess problem hardness, using both exact and heuristic algorithms. We find that quasiplanar instances with Union-Jack-like connectivity can be solved to optimality for up to thousands of nodes within minutes, with both custom and generic commercial solvers on commodity hardware, without any instance-specific fine-tuning. We also perform a scaling analysis, showing that by relaxing the constraints on the classical simulated annealing algorithms considered in Ebadi et al., our implementation is competitive with the quantum algorithms. Conversely, instances with larger connectivity or less structure are shown to display a time-to-solution potentially orders of magnitudes larger. Based on these results, we propose protocols to systematically tune problem hardness, motivating experiments with Rydberg atom arrays on instances orders of magnitude harder (for established classical solvers) than previously studied.},
